Simple br_if conditions in: 2.
Simple br conditions in: .
Loop block: [1 2 3]
Code paths from the root bblock to a loop bblock and the VM state at the conclusion of the loop bblock:
[0 1]
cost:    5; 
stack:   []; 
params:  [pN0, pn1]; 
locals:  [];

Simple brif loop condition in bblock 2:	(pN0 shr_u 3) != 0
Loop condition variables: pN0
SSA of loop:
-t0 = pn1
-t1 = -1
-t2 = t0 + t1
-pn1 = t2
-t4 = pN0
-t5 = i32.wrap_i64(t4)
-t6 = 7
-t7 = t5 && t6
-t8 = 48
-t9 = t7 || t8
-@(t2) = (t9)
-t11 = pN0
-t12 = 3
-t13 = t11 shr_u t12
-pN0 = t13
-t15 = 0
-t16 = t13 != t15
Loop variable calculations:
+pN0 = pN0 shr_u 3
