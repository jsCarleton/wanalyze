Code paths from the root bblock to a loop bblock and the VM state at the conclusion of the loop bblock:
[0 1 2] 32
cost:    32; 
stack:   []; 
params:  [pn0, (pn2 - pn3) < 256, pn2 - pn3, pn3, pn4]; 
locals:  [5400608 - 256]; 
globals: [5400608 - 256]

Simple brif loop condition in bblock 3:	(pn2 + -256) > 255
Loop condition variables: pn2
SSA of loop:
-t0 = pn0
-t1 = ln5
-t2 = 256
-t3 = pn2
-t4 = -256
-t5 = t3 + t4
-pn2 = t5
-t7 = 255
-t8 = t5 > t7
Loop variable calculations:
+pn2 = pn2 + -256
