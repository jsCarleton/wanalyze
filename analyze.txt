Design notes on analyzing the wasm module once the in-memory data structures representing it have been created.

This is about analyzing functions.
- rename get_segments to segments_of_expr
- update the func definition to contain the segment definitions
type func =
{
  locals:   local_type list;
  e:        expr;
  (* new *)
  segments: list Segments.segment;
}
- change update_code_section to call segments_of_expr
- when printing a function use the segments from the func
