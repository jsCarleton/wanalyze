Loops

A loop body is a set of consecutive basic blocks with the following properties:
- the first basic block is of type loop,
- the nesting of the first basic block is the "loop nesting",
- the last basic block is of type end and it has nesting "loop nesting",
- every other basic block has nesting greater than the "loop nestint"

Loop body properties:
- entry paths: the set of basic block paths that can enter a loop
- exit basic blocks: the end, br and br_if basic blocks whose target basic block
  is outside the loop body

Entry path properties:

Loop path properties:

Exit basic block properties:
- branch condition: the condition (of the if or br_if) under which the loop is exitted
- branch variables: the variables used in the branch condition
- branch variable possible initial values: the set of values that the branch variables can contain
  upon entry to the loop
- paths to exit basic block: the possible paths within the loop to the exit block

Paths to exit basic block properties:
- branch variable updates: the SSA simplification of the branch variables in the exit basic blocks
